Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery (ajax calls)
- JSON
- API's (Pokémon and Weather)

Approach:

I wanted to make an app that allowed the user to search for Pokémon by either name or ID#. That search would return information about the specific Pokémon and includes pictures of their regular version and shiny version.

I included 3 features that my users could enjoy: 

The first is a Pokémon quiz. The quiz generates a random shiny back view of a Pokémon and the user would have to type their guess into the input box to see if they could guess the Pokémon correctly.

The second is a mini Pokémon battle story. It generates two random Pokémon that would engage in an automated battle that the user could experience by clicking through each battle event in alert windows that pop up.

The third is Pokémon weather. This feature allows the user to enter their zip code to get the current weather for their area.

Technical Challenges:

My main challenges were initially grabbing data from the Pokémon and Weather API's. I really had to read and make sure I understood the documentation for both API's before I was able to utilize the information in thier.

Another challenge I had was deploying my site on Netlify. I realized I wasn't using the right path to my files in my Github repo. Once I got that issue fixed, I was able to deploy my site with ease.

Possible Improvements:

I would make improvements to my quiz and battle story features.

For my quiz, in the future I would like the make it multiple choice instead of the user typing in their input. It would give the user a better chance of answering correctly.

For the battle story, I would like to actually make it a game where the user can choose a Pokémon and that Pokémon would have a choice of moves that the user can pick to attack a randomly generated Pokémon.

I wanted to focus on making my features work and make my app responsive first before making any improvements to the features. I'm hoping to be able to refine these things in the future with more time.
